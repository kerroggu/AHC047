- Implemented a minimal solver in a.cpp
- Selected the highest weighted string and output a deterministic Markov chain cycling through that string.
- Verified compilation and ran the program on test cases 0000 to 0014.
- Could not compute scores locally because visualizer requires network dependencies.
- Future work: vendor Rust dependencies or pre-build the tester for offline scoring.
